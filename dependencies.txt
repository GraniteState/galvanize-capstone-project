Spark includes it's own version of Maven, so just go to the directory for the source code.
Build spark from the latest version using a clone of the github repo using the following line:
`./build/mvn -Pyarn -Phadoop-2.7 -Dhadoop.version=2.7.3 -Dscala-2.11 -Pnetlib-lgpl -DskipTests clean package`

Build OpenBLAS from a clone of the github repo by running `make` in the directory where the repo is saved. Then 
use `sudo make PREFIX=/opt/OpenBLAS install` to install it in a directory. Add the directory `/opt/OpenBLAS/lib to 
`/etc/ld.so.conf.d/openblas.conf` and run `ldconfig` to load the new libraries.
